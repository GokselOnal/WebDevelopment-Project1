### Short Description of project
This project was designed as a simple cryptocurrency trading site.In the construction of the project, examples were taken from sites such as Binance coinmarkcap,they were used as a reference. Our aim to make this project is that we knew that there are many successful sites and exchanges about crypto money in the world, we felt that Turkey was lacking in this regard, we decided to make our site.

### Instructions for how to run the application
The register page is designed for people to become a member of the site. After filling in all the information,people can become a member by clicking the register button.Members can easily log in from the login page when they want to log in to the site. When people log in, they will be transferred to the MainPage.In the left corner on the MainPage, people can easily see their financial status and the number of their coins, on the right, they can buy and sell the coins they want, and finally, when they click on the coin, they have redirected to the page a piece of detailed information about the coin.
